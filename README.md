# AWK Compiler - Introduction and Overview
Overview
This project is an AWK compiler implemented in Java, consisting of a lexer, parser, and interpreter. The goal of the project is to provide a tool for translating AWK code into executable instructions.

Components
1. Lexer
The lexer is responsible for breaking down the AWK source code into individual tokens. It recognizes keywords, operators, literals, and other language elements, creating a stream of tokens that serve as input for the parser.

2. Parser
The parser processes the token stream generated by the lexer and builds a parse tree. It enforces the grammatical structure of AWK and verifies that the input conforms to the language's syntax rules.

3. Interpreter
The interpreter traverses the parse tree and executes the AWK program. It interprets the high-level instructions generated by the parser and manipulates data according to the specified patterns and actions in the AWK code.

Thank you for looking at my project!
